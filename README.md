# Exercises Introduction to Reinforcement Learning

Repository with Examples and Exercises for an Introuductory Reinforcement Learning Course. Based on the Sutton/Barto Textbook 
and David Silver RL course

The files in this repository are based on Gymnasium (farama foundation) and KERAS (for Deep Reinforcement Learning)
Some examples are with Pytorch as well <br>
They are kept as simple as possible for educational purposes

They are not created to beat any score, but to compare and learn the differences between the approaches.
