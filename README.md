# Examples Course Introduction to Reinforcement Learning

Repository with Examples and Exercises for an Introuductory Reinforcement Learning Course. Based on the Sutton/Barto Textbook 
and David Silver RL course

The files in this repository are based on Gymnasium (farama foundation) and KERAS (for Deep Reinforcement Learning) <br>
Some examples are build with Pytorch as well <br>

They are kept as simple as possible for educational purposes

They are not created to beat any score, but to compare and learn the differences between the approaches.
